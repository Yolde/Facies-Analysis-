This project employed machine learning techniques to classify facies from well log data, significantly improving subsurface characterization and reservoir modeling. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, the project streamlined the interpretation of complex geological data, transforming raw well log measurements into actionable insights. The classification process enabled more accurate facies identification, enhancing the understanding of reservoir heterogeneity and contributing to more effective reservoir management strategies. The solution reduced manual interpretation time and provided a data-driven approach to optimize decision-making in reservoir modeling and management.
